# Clima - Weather App with Flutter

Welcome to the repository of Clima, a weather application developed using Flutter that provides real-time climate data using the OpenWeatherMap API. This project is designed to help you learn and master various Flutter concepts.

## Project Objectives:

- **Hands-on Learning:** Clima is a practical exploration of Flutter concepts, emphasizing asynchronous programming, network requests, JSON parsing, navigation, and exception handling.

- **Real-time Data:** The app fetches weather data from OpenWeatherMap API, showcasing how to work with APIs and handle JSON responses in a Flutter application.

- **User Interaction:** Implementing features such as live location data with the Geolocator package and user input with the TextField Widget.

## Key Features:

- **Asynchronous Tasks with Dart:** Explore Dart's asynchronous capabilities, including async and await, while working with Futures.

- **Network Requests with Dart HTTP Package:** Utilize the Dart http package to make seamless network requests and retrieve weather data.

- **API Integration:** Learn how to work with APIs, fetching real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap.

- **JSON Parsing with Dart Convert Package:** Understand JSON data and parse it using the Dart convert package to extract relevant information.

- **Navigation with Navigator:** Implement effective screen navigation, passing data forwards and backward between screens using the Navigator.

- **Exception Handling in Dart:** Explore the basics of exception handling in Dart using try, catch, and throw for graceful error handling.

- **Stateful Widgets Lifecycle:** Gain insights into the lifecycle of Stateful Widgets and learn how to override methods for efficient state management.

- **Geolocator Package for Live Location Data:** Utilize the Geolocator package to obtain live location data, supporting both iOS and Android platforms.

- **User Input with TextField Widget:** Implement the TextField Widget to capture user input, allowing users to customize and interact with the application.
